The sis18_accel.py script propagates a bunch through the sis18 lattice with
RF cavities set for acceleration at about 0.1 MeV/turn.  The script
plot_emit.py plots the results of the turn_accel_full2.h5 diagnostics file
showing the emittance and invariant emittances, momentum and energy as a
function of turn number.
