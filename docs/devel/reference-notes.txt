Notes on state and coordinates.

1) The transverse 0 of coordinates for particles and reference particle state
   is defined by the center of the elements
  a) What about rbends? Eric says true for entrance and exit.
2) The longitudinal coordinates for particles and reference particle state
  is defined relative to the reference particle energy and absolute time.
3) Note: there is no logical relative s.
4) Reference particle state has to propagate
5) A single train has a single reference particle

rbends: rbends have three relevant lengths: physical element length, arc length,
  and trajectory length.


  Todo:
  1) reference particle needs to track three things: absolute z (zabs),
  absolute t (tabs) and total s, (s).
    a) zabs is the sum of element lengths
    b) tabs is the trajectory time
    c) s is the total trajectory path length
  2) need to add to z_n.
  3) need to propagate reference particle state every time bunch is propagated
  4) in train propagation, reference particle has to be synchronized across
    bunches after propagation.
