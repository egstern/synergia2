fodo

This is the simplest examples the Synergia authors could think off. Such a system has been described on various
occasions (see for instance the notes from the USPAS accelerator school coarse by Mike Syphers_ et al). Both
single particle optic and collective effect are demonstrated. This example runs in a few minutes on a single CPU
(or core) system. 

The lattice is of the simple Focus-Defocus (FoDo) type, one focusing quadrupole followed by a short drift, 
and one defocusing quadrupole of the same strength ending with a drift of the same length.  
The phase advance for a cell is xx km.  

To get going, first, execute the setup shell script found in the top level directory where the Synergia package
was installed::

% source .../Synergia/synergia2-refactor/setup.sh
