Tips and tricks:

To test the checkpointing and associated serialization, I did:

mpirun -n 3 ./cxx_ecloudexample

Then kill (ctrl-C), after running for ~ 2.5 turns 
(as I ask for checkpointing every 2 turns.)   

Then, 

mpirun -n 3 synergia-resume

And it works, test with the option of 3 10^13 particles in the bunch.
