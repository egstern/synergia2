This benchmark is based on the circular.py example but with statistics
writing disabled.  Example runs:

A medium sized synergia job:

synergia circ.py tgridnumx=64 tgridnumy=64 lgridnum=128 partpercell=10

A large sized job

synergia circ.py tgridnumx=1024 tgridnumy=128 lgridnum=128 partpercell=100
