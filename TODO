* Numerical/physics tests:
** Fixed_t_z_zeroth tests. Current tests only check that the converters are 
   inverses.

* Implementation:
** Fixed_t_z_ballistic currently consists of stubs only.
** Bunch.get_comm() needs (correct) python wrapping. 
   Currently implemented, but commented out.
** The units on emittance in Diagnostics_full2 need to be converted
   to conventional values.
