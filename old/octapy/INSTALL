octapy does not yet use distutils. For the time being, the included
Makefile contains all that is needed to build octapy. The only
site-specific information is the location of the Python includes. Edit
the first line of the Makefile for your site.

make
	should build the octapy Python module.

make demo
	will demonstrate the features of octapy.

Requirements:
	1) Python
	2) Octave
	3) For development only: Swig
